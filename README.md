## Approach  

My approach for this project was to meet my minimum viable product(MVP) that included full CRUD functionality allowing a user to sign in and view, add and delete items from their grocery list.
  

### MVP  

#### 7 Restful Roots
| **URL** | **HTTP Verb** |  **Action**|
|------------|-------------|------------|
| /        | GET       | index  
| /auth/signup         | GET       | new   
| /auth/signup          | POST      | create   
| /users/profile/:id      | GET       | show       
| /users/profile/:id/edit | GET       | edit       
| /users/profile/:id/edit      | PATCH/PUT | update    
| /users/profile/:id/edit     | DELETE    | destroy
